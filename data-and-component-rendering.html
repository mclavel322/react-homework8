      INSTRUCTIONS:

      This time, we assembled the data for you,
      and built the component you need to display and individual band member.

      But the Band component doesn't return anything yet.

      1) Make the band component map over each of the bandMembers.
      2) Pass each individual band member's data down to a Beatle component as props
      3) Dont forget to add a unique key for each band member.

      Make sure you can see each Beatle on the screen,
      and that there are no errors in console.
